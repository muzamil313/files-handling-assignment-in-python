        "\n",
        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- In compiled languages, the entire source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. This machine code is then run directly by the computer's CPU,while as  Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line using an interpreter, translating each instruction into machine code at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling is a mechanism that allows you to manage errors gracefully during program execution. Instead of abruptly terminating the program when an error occurs, Python provides constructs to catch and handle exceptions, enabling the program to continue running or to fail gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- In Python, the finally block is a crucial part of exception handling that ensures certain code executes regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This guarantees that essential cleanup actions—like closing files, releasing resources, or resetting states—are performed, maintaining the program's stability and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, logging refers to the process of recording events that occur during the execution of a program. This is achieved using the built-in logging module, which provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, the __del__ method is a special instance method known as a finalizer. It is automatically invoked by the garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing you to define custom cleanup actions such as releasing external resources like files, network connections, or database handles.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, both import and from ... import statements are used to include external modules or specific attributes from modules into your current script. However, they differ in how they introduce these names into your namespace and how you access them thereafter.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- Here are several approaches to manage multiple exceptions effectively:\n",

        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading means running multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within the same process concurrently,while as multiprocessing means Running multiple processes independently and in parallel, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",

        "-  Memory management in Python refers to how Python allocates, uses, and frees memory during the execution of a program. It ensures efficient use of memory resources and helps prevent memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The basic steps involved in exception handling in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Write the code that might raise an exception inside a try block:\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Use one or more except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions:\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Optionally use an else block:\n",

        " 4. Optionally use a finally block:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "-  Memory management is important in Python because it ensures that your program runs efficiently, reliably, and without consuming excessive system resources\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Role of try:\n",
        "  1. The try block contains code that might raise an exception during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Python runs this code and watches for any errors.\n",

        "  3. If no exceptions occur, the try block completes normally.\n",

        "15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python’s garbage collection system automatically manages memory by identifying and freeing objects that are no longer needed, helping prevent memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  os.fork() is a low-level system call (available mainly on Unix/Linux systems) that creates a new child process by duplicating the current process. The child is an exact copy of the parent at the moment of the fork, while as multiprocessing is a high-level Python module that abstracts process creation and management. It works on both Unix and Windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Closing a file in Python is important because it ensures that system resources are properly released and that data is safely written and saved.\n",

        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
